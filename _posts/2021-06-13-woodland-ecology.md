title: "Plant monitoring - Drummin"
description: "MOn 13 th June we had a day with Dr Micheline Sheehy-Skeffington (see separate report) which she
provided free of charge in order to allow us to afford the Bat training day. We studied an area of
Drummin Wood where we saw a number of rare orchids (Sword-leaved Helleborine) (which had
been previously recorded 10 years ago) and a new recording for the rare Cow Wheat which are an
indication of the importance of this ancient oak woodland. We did a survey exercise of a 100 sqare
metre quadrat which covered species identification and recording the woodland structure including
natural regeneration."
