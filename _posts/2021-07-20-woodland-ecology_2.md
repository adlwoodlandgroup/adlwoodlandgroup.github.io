title: "Woodland Ecology - Lahardaun"
description: "On 27 th June, a group of us went with ecologist Dr Cilian Roden to walk in the vicinity of the river and
tributaries where he helped us to identify trees, shrubs and ground flora and explained their natural
habitats and how to monitor their distribution and health. We learned about monitoring techniques
including quadrat and transect surveys and looked at important water and water-edge species that
help to indicate water quality. We also considered how management might affect the ecosystem.
Dr Roden recommended that we map a specific area of riparian buffer zone connecting existing
native woodlands and divide it into compartments to be monitored with a view to improved
management for biodiversity."
