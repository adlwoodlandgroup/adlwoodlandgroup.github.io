title: "Bat monitoring"
description: "Vincent Wildlife Trust provided a Citizen Science Bat Ecology &amp; Detector Training
Course to members of the Abhainn Dá Loilíoch (ADL) Woodland Group at Crann Óg
Eco Farm, Derrymore, Drummin Gort, Co. Galway on September 4 th , 2021. This
course was facilitated by CELT.
The trainers were Dr Kate McAney and Ruth Hanniffy.
The course commenced at 18:00hrs with an introduction to the nine bat species in
Ireland, their characteristic physical features, key roosting sites and foraging
habitats, and the main points to note when using bat detectors for their
identification in the field.
Each participant was provided with a handout with details of the nine species and
guidance on how to differentiate them in the field using bat detectors. Audio calls
of the bats were played so participants could acquaint themselves with the key
features of the calls including an approximate description, for example a click or
warble, duration, rhythm, intensity, and repetition rate. Guidelines were also
given on how to conduct a bat detector survey of an area.
After a short break, the group assembled at dusk to observe the emergence of
soprano pipistrelles from an adjacent building. This allowed the variation in calls
emitted by bats when close to a building and then while commuting and foraging
to be demonstrated. Each participant was given a Magenta heterodyne bat
detector and instructed on how to use this, particularly the importance of
continually varying the frequency setting.
The group then walked away from the farm with the detectors set at different
frequencies so that a variety of bat species could be surveyed. In addition to the
Magenta detectors, Ruth Hanniffy operated a Song Meter 4 (SM4) Passive Detector
that detects ultrasonic calls across a range of frequencies and stores the resulting
recordings onto a Sound Card for later software analysis. The walk terminated at a
water body at which Daubenton’s bats were clearly observed flying over the
surface of the water. The final bat recordings were made at 23:31hrs and the
course finished at midnight.
Ruth Hanniffy subsequently analysed the recordings from SM4, and these confirmed
the identifications made in real time using the Magenta detectors.
The bat species detected during the course were as follows, in the order in which
they were detected, which reflects their time of emergence and foraging times.
Leisler’s bat (Nyctalus leisleri)
Soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus)
Common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus)
Brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auratus)
Whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus)
Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentoni)"
