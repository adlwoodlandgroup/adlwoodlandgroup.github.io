title: "Water Quality Training"
description: "Some group members joined LAWPRO local Water Officer, Conor Ruane, on four separate occasions
to identify suitable monitoring locations along the river and tributaries and to learn monitoring skills.
Numerous kick-samples were taken and studied and various organisms were identified. Conor
explained how different organisms indicated either good or bad water quality and taught us how to
use the findings to take a measurement of the level of water quality. By regular monitoring we will
be able to identify areas where land management might be affecting the water quality and thus we
can aim to improve management where necessary."
