title: "Fungi Training with Tom Harrington"
description: "'Our trainer for the day was Dr Thomas Harrington, Emeritus Lecturer in plant science, ecology and
genetics University of Limerick with a speciality in mycology.
The day was split in two halves, the morning in Lahardaun/Chevy Chase identifying fungi in mixed
coniferous and deciduous woodland, and the afternoon spent in Drummin wood. The idea was to
compare species between the two.
Tom helped us identify mushrooms as we found them, explaining the key characteristics of the
genera, and particular smells, textures and features of species. He also talked about the ecology of
the various fungi types, the importance of habitat and poisonous species.
On the whole we identified roughly 80 species on the day, with not much overlap between the two
sites and with a greater diversity in Drummin wood. We found a good selection of the most
important woodland edible fungi and examples of mycorrhizal, saprotrophic and parasitic fungi.
The next step will be to work on species lists for these sites and Gortacarnaun woods over the next
years to build up a picture of what is present and in particular find any rare or ancient woodland
indicator species."
