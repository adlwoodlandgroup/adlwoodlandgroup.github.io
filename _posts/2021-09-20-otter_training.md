title: "Otter Training"
description: "'In September 2021, the group had a one day training with Dr Paddy Sleeman, a mammalogist based
'in UCC.
'We surveyed two stretches of the Abhainn Dá Loilíoch river bank, one upstream and downstream of
'the bridge at Lahardaun, the other downstream of the bridge on Lough Cutra Drive.
'In all locations we found numerous signs of otter presence.
'Dr Sleeman taught us how to identify otter spraint, how to photograph these and upload data to the
'NBDC.
'We also learned about otter biology and behaviour and about methods for capturing hair samples
'for DNA analysis.
'For ongoing monitoring work we have now set up our own email account with the NBDC, which will
'mean that our own data will be accessible to us in map form."
