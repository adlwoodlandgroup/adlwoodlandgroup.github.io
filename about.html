        <p>
        To collaborate with the local community, statutory bodies, and ecologists to restore and increase
        native woodlands in the Abhainn Dá Loilíoch Valley.</p>
        <h4>The woodlands</h4>
        <p>
        The Abhainn Dá Loilíoch (Owendalullegh river) Woodland Group’s central focus is three ancient
        woodlands that were once part of the great forest of Aughty and are among only a tiny fraction that
        still remains. The woods are: Gortacarnaun Wood (R5097, c95ha) on the south bank of the river,
        Drummin Wood (R5199, c60ha) 1km north of the river and Lahardaun Wood (R5398, c20ha) on the
        north bank of the river and 2km east of the other woods. At 95ha Gortacarnaun is one of the largest
        ancient oak-woods in Ireland. Lahardaun Wood once covered a substantially larger area than it does
        today and only a fraction of the former oak-woods remains. Most of Lahardaun Wood is now
        covered with Sitka spruce plantation. Gortacarnaun and Drummin woods are now special areas of
        conservation (SAC site codes 2081 and 2080, respectively) and both have multiple ownership.
        Lahardaun Wood is Coillte property.

        <h4>Mapping</h4>
        <p>
        Members of our group have recently carried out some mapping
        of older oak trees in Lahardaun.
